## Hello! I'm Giulia 👋

## About me
I'm a dedicated web developer passionate about crafting user-centric and visually engaging websites.
My main stack is JavaScript: I use Express on the backend, and React/Next.js on the frontend to deliver high-quality web solutions.  
I also work with relational databases like SQL Server and PostgreSQL, and I'm currently expanding my skills into C# and full-stack .NET Core development with Razor Pages.

- ✨ Experienced in building websites and webapps from scratch.
- 🎨 Passionate about turning design mockups into code (Figma lover!)  
- 🤝 Always eager to collaborate with teams on corporate projects
